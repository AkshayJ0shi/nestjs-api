Guide to using NextJS
* We start from main.ts file which is the entry point for our app. Here we define port for server and express() is imported from NextFactory.
* We initialize AppModule which contains all our top level imports such as service providers and controllers.
* In NestJS, it is common practice to create a directory for a specific concern. ( meg : Student Directory ) which ships all the relevant code.
* In the DTO (Data Transfer Object) Directory, we declare classes for types of incoming request. Purpose of DTO is typechecking.
* There is no controllers directory. Controller file is found in the same directory as DTO. 
* From DTO we get to type check out request. All the controller specific comments are in student.controller.ts file.
* Then we create a service file which provides all the function definitions. eg : student.service.ts. 
* This file is supposed to create a class which is exported to app.module.ts along with controller. 
* All the service.ts specific notes are in student.service.ts.
* Pipes in NextJS are used as validators for request data type. If request data is invalid, that request doesnt reach controller.
* Middlewares are similar to express. Check out src/common/middlewares/validStudent.middleware.ts
