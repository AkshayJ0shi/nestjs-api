Guide to using NextJS

1. We start from main.ts file which is the entry point for our app. Here we define port for server and express() is imported from NextFactory.
2. We initialize AppModule which contains all our top level imports such as service providers and controllers.
3. In NestJS, it is common practice to create a directory for a specific concern. ( meg : Student Directory ) which ships all the relevant code.
4. In the DTO (Data Transfer Object) Directory, we declare classes for types of incoming request. Purpose of DTO is typechecking.
5. There is no controllers directory. Controller file is found in the same directory as DTO. 
6. From DTO we get to type check out request. All the controller specific comments are in student.controller.ts file.
7. Then we create a service file which provides all the function definitions. eg : student.service.ts. 
8. This file is supposed to create a class which is exported to app.module.ts along with controller. 
9. All the service.ts specific notes are in student.service.ts.
10.Pipes in NextJS are used as validators for request data type. If request data is invalid, that request doesnt reach controller.
11.Middlewares are similar to express. Check out src/common/middlewares/validStudent.middleware.ts
